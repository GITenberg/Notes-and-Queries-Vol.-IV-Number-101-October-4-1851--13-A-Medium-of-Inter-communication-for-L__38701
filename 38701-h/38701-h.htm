<h3><span>BATTLE OF BRUNANBURGH.</span></h3>

<p>It is remarkable that the site of this great battle, the effects of
which were so important to the Anglo-Saxon power, remains to this day
undetermined.</p>

<p>The several chroniclers who describe it give various names to the
locality, though modern authors generally adopt the name of Brunanburgh
or "Town of the Fountains." Not however to insist on such variations in
the name as Brunandune, Bruneberik, Bruneford, and Brumby, Simeon of
Durham describes the battle as occurring at a place named Wendune,
otherwise Weondune, to which moreover he assigns the further name of
Ethrunnanwerch. The locality has been sought for in most improbable
places,&mdash;in Northumberland and Cheshire. There can, however, be little
or no doubt that this Waterloo of the Anglo-Saxons, as it has been
called, is really to be found in the immediate neighbourhood of the
Humber; though, whether on the northern or southern bank of that river
seems quite uncertain: so far at least as the evidence hitherto adduced
affords us the means of judging. In the Winchester volume of the British
Archæological Association, M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ESLEDEN</span> states his belief that he has
traced the site of this battle on the south of the Humber, near Barton
in Lincolnshire; but the evidence on which he grounds this opinion,
whilst demanding for this locality further consideration, seems to me
far from conclusive. M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ESLEDEN</span> describes some curious earth-works in
this situation, and thinks he has discovered the site of Anlaff's camp
at Barrow, and that of Athelstan at Burnham (formerly, as he informs us,
written "Brunnum"), where is an eminence called "Black Hold," which he
thinks was the actual seat of the battle. At Barrow are places called
"<i>Barrow Bogs</i>" and "<i>Blow Wells</i>." Does M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ESLEDEN</span> think we have here
any reference to the "fountains" giving their name to Brunanburgh?</p>

<p>It is very desirable, in a topographical and historical point of view,
that the site of this remarkable contest between the Anglo-Saxons and
the allied Scandinavians and British <i>reguli</i> under Anlaff, should be
determined on satisfactory data; and the allusion to it by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ESLEDEN</span>,
in a recent communication to "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" (Vol. iv., p. 180.),
induces me to call the attention of your readers, and of that gentleman
in particular, to some mention of this battle, topographically not
unimportant, which is to be found in Egil's <i>Saga</i>; the hero of which
was himself a combatant at Brunanburgh, under the standard of Athelstan,
and which appears to have escaped the observation of those who have
discussed the probable site of this deadly encounter. The circumstantial
account to be found in the <i>Saga</i>, chap. lii. and liii., has not been
overlooked by<a id="by250"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[250]</span>
 Sharon Turner, who however does not quote the
passages having a special topographical interest. It is remarkable that
the name of Wendune, for which among Anglo-Saxon writers there appears
the single authority of Simeon of Durham, is confirmed by the testimony
of the <i>Saga</i>: at least there can be little doubt, that the <i>Vinheida</i>
of the <i>Saga</i> is but a Norse form for the Wendun or Weondune of the
Anglo-Saxon chronicler. The natural and other features of the locality
are not neglected by the author of the <i>Saga</i>, who describes it as a
wild and uncultivated spot, surrounded by woods, having the town of
<i>Vinheida</i> not far distant on the north. These particulars I take from
the Latin of the <i>Saga</i>; but the reader of the Icelandic would possibly
find more minute characteristics, which may have been lost in the
process of translation. As, by his residence in the neighbourhood,
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ESLEDEN</span> is favourably situated for the further prosecution of this
inquiry, I should be glad to find whether his conclusion as to the site
of the battle received confirmation, or otherwise, from the passages of
the <i>Saga</i> to which I have now ventured to direct attention.</p>

<p>I may here observe, that if we consider the situation of <i>Jorvik</i>, or
York, the capital of the then Norse kingdom of Northumbria, we shall
perhaps conclude that it was on the Yorkshire rather than on the
Lincolnshire side of the Humber, that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

  <p class="i3"> "Athelstan, king,</p>
  <p class="i3">of earls the Lord,</p>
  <p> of heroes the bracelet-giver,</p>
  <p class="i3">And his brother eke,</p>
  <p class="i3">Edmund etheling,</p>
  <p class="i5"> life-long-glory</p>
  <p class="i5"> in battle won</p>
  <p class="i3"> with edges of swords</p>
  <p class="i5">near Brumby."</p>

</div>

<p>This conclusion is to some extent confirmed, when we connect with the
above the tradition or historical fact, whichever we regard it, that it
was after this battle that Athelstan, in redemption of a previous vow,
made various costly offerings on the altar of St. John of Beverley, and
endowed that church with great privileges, the memory of which exists to
the present day. It must however be admitted, that such a presumption is
anything but conclusive in regard to a topographical question of this
description. In conclusion, I would suggest that the Domesday Book for
Yorkshire and Lincolnshire should be carefully examined, in order to
ascertain whether the place in question, under any of the names assigned
to it, is there to be found.</p>

<h3><span>THE CAXTON COFFER.</span></h3>


 <p class="blockquot">  "Sans titres on fait des romans; pour écrire l'histoire il faut
   des preuves authentiques, des monumens certains."&mdash;J. J. Oberlin,
   <i>Annales de la vie de Jean Gutenberg</i>.</p>

<p>Gratified by the approbation with which my suggestion of a <i>Caxton
memorial</i> has been received, both publicly and privately, and acquiring
fresh confidence in its success, it is my intention to make a second
appeal to the lovers of literature when the excitement of the present
year shall have passed away, and home-subjects shall re-assume their
wonted powers of attraction.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I recommend an assemblage of notes on the life and
works of Caxton, designed to correct current errors; to expose baseless
conjectures; to indicate probable sources of information, or to furnish
such novel information as research may produce; and to assist in
establishing the principles on which such a memorial as that suggested
should be prepared and edited.</p>

<p>In justification of this advice, I must express my belief that there
have been few men of celebrity on whose life and labours so many
erroneous statements, and inadmissible conjectures, have been published
in works of general repute.</p>

<p>Requesting the favour of contributions to <i>The Caxton coffer</i> from such
persons as may take an interest in the success of the enterprise, I now
proceed to set an example:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">   "I have a great number of books printed by Caxton, and in very
   good condition, except a very few. I think the number is
   forty-two. Have you any notes relating to that good honest man? I
   think he deserves those titles, and if I may add industrious
   too."&mdash;Edward, earl of Oxford, to Thomas Hearne, 1731.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "In Osborne's shop-catalogue for 1749, No. 5954, occurs the
   'Catalogue of the late E. of Oxford's library, as it was
   purchased, (being the original) inlaid with royal paper, in 16
   vols. 4to. with the prices prefixed to each book&mdash;pr.&nbsp;10.&nbsp;10.&nbsp;0.&mdash;N.B. There never was any other copy of this catalogue with
   the prices added to it.'&mdash;The same article, at the same price, is
   repeated in his cat. for 1750, No. 6583, and for 1751, No.
   6347&mdash;after which, being discontinued in his subsequent cats. it
   was probably sold. Qu<span class="topnum">y</span>. to whom and where is it now?"&mdash;Richard
   Heber, c. 1811.</p>


<p>The first of the above notes is copied from <i>Letters written by eminent
persons</i>, London [Oxford], 1813. 8<span class="topnum">o</span>. The second note, which concludes
with a <i>query</i>, forms part of some manuscript memoranda, now in my
possession, on the matchless library to which it refers.</p>


<p class="right">   B<span class="smcap lowercase">OLTON</span> C<span class="smcap lowercase">ORNEY</span>.</p>





<h3><span>ACCURACY OF PRINTING.</span></h3>

<p>Much of the <i>copy</i> forwarded by the contributors to "N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>"
contains quotations from old books; which I presume are accurately
given, without alteration of spelling or punctuation.<a id="or251"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[251]</span> The
difficulty is this; that the printer, or perhaps even the editor, may
sometimes alter what he supposes to be a <i>contributor's</i> error of
copying. Thus, in Query 93. (Vol. iv., p. 151.), there is <i>medulla
grammaticæ</i>, where I wrote <i>grammatice</i>, as in my authority: but the
vile punctuation of the subsequent extract (which is also that of the
original) is duly preserved. It would be desirable to have some symbol
by which to call attention to the fact that some glaring error is real
quotation, and is to be preserved in printing. For example, an indented
line (~~~~) drawn under the words in question, or at the side, would
warn the printer that he is not to correct any error, however gross. If
you would suggest this, or any other method, and request your
contributors generally to adopt it, an increased degree of confidence in
the quotations would result.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  [We are quite alive to the importance of our correspondent's
   suggestion. The excuse for such corrections by compositors and
   readers is, that copy frequently comes into their hands in such a
   state, that if they did not exercise a power somewhat beyond the
   strict limit of their duty, they would commit greater sins, and
   give more of offence both to writers and readers. It may be
   feared that some compositors would not know what was meant by an
   indented line, and would (especially if it was not carefully
   made) take it as a direction for <i>Italics</i>. The object may,
   however, probably be attained by the writer's placing in the
   margin, or in the line, or between the lines, so as to be either
   above or below the particular word or phrase to which it is meant
   to refer, the word "sic," with a line completely round it. All
   persons concerned in the practical part of printing understand,
   that "matter" which is thus circumscribed or circumlineated, is
   not to be printed, but is a private communication for the benefit
   of such readers of the written copy as it may concern. If there
   are many lines which require this caution, it will generally be
   enough to mark one or two of the first instances, for that will
   suffice to show that the writer knows that he is doing, and means
   to do, what looks as if it wanted correction.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  We are inclined to add one suggestion, for which this seems to be
   a good opportunity, because it is peculiarly inapplicable to the
   correspondent who has drawn from us these remarks. It is this,
   that as those who know that they are telling a story which is
   likely to excite doubt, take more than usual care to put on a
   grave and honest countenance, so those who know that they are
   writing what is bad or questionable in grammar, spelling, &amp;c.,
   should use the precaution of being peculiarly legible.]</p>

<p>&mdash;It is
curious that a similar practice to that of discovering the bodies of the
drowned by loading a loaf with mercury, and putting it afloat on the
stream, extracted from the <i>Gent. Mag.</i>, seems to exist among the North
American Indians. Sir James Alexander, in his account of Canada
(<i>L'Acadie</i>, 2 vols., 1849), says, p. 26.:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">   "The Indians imagine that in the case of a drowned body, its
   place may be discovered by floating a chip of cedar wood, which
   will stop and turn round over the exact spot: an instance
   occurred within my own knowledge, in the case of Mr. Lavery of
   Kingston Mill, whose boat overset, and the person was drowned
   near Cedar Island; nor could the body be discovered until this
   experiment was resorted to."</p>

<h3><span>SERMON OF BISHOP JEREMY TAYLOR.</span></h3>

<p>I have a 12mo. volume entitled&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">   "Christ's Yoke an easy Yoke, and yet the Gate to Heaven a
   straight Gate: in two excellent Sermons, well worthy the serious
   Perusal of the strictest Professors. By a Learned and Reverend
   Divine. Heb. xi. 4.: <i>Who being dead yet speaketh</i>. London,
   printed for F. Smith, at the Elephant and Castle, near the Royal
   Exchange in Cornhill, 1675."</p>

<p class="noindent">Pp. 92., Exclusive of Preface.<a id="of252"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[252]</span></p>

<p>Facing the title-page is a portrait of Bishop Taylor, engraved by Van
Hove. The Preface, without mentioning the author's name, informs the
reader that the two sermons following, "by means of a person of Honour
yet living, are now come into the press for public use and benefit." The
first sermon is on Matt. xi. 30.: "For my Yoke is easy, and my Burthen
is light;" and is contained in Taylor's <i>Life of Christ</i> (Eden's edit.
of his <i>Works</i>, vol. ii. pp. 515-528.). The second sermon is on Luke
xiii. 23, 24., and begins "The life of a Christian is a perpetual
contention for mastery;" and ends, "If we strive according to his holy
Injunctions, we shall certainly enter, according to his holy promises,
but else upon condition." This sermon does not appear, as far as I have
been able to discover, in any collection of Taylor's Works, nor amongst
his Sermons in the new edition; nor do I find the volume itself noticed
by any of his biographers. It would be extraordinary if, when so much
has been printed as part of his works which did not belong to him, a
sermon indisputably his should have been omitted by all his various
editors; a sermon, too, which every reader will allow to be a fine one.
Perhaps the rev. editor of the new edition of Taylor's <i>Works</i> can
explain the reason of this omission. I shall be glad to be corrected if
I have overlooked the sermon in any part of the Bishop's collected
Works.</p>

<h3><span>COWLEY AND GRAY, NO. II.</span></h3>

<p>Gray, when alluding to Shakspeare, in his Pindaric ode on "The Progress
of Poesy," had probably Cowley in memory:</p>

<div class="poem">

         <p class="i3"> "Far from the sun and summer gale,</p>
     <p> In thy green lap was Nature's Darling laid,</p>
    <p>  What time, where lucid Avon stray'd.</p>
        <p class="i3">To him the mighty mother did unveil</p>
      <p>Her awful face: <i>the dauntless child</i></p>
     <p> <i>Stretch'd forth his little arms and smil'd</i>."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Wakefield, in one of his notes, remarks on this&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">    "An allusion perhaps, to that verse of Virgil,</p>

  <div class="poem">

   <p> 'Incipe, parve puer, risu cognoscere matrem.'"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Instead of Virgil, I suspect that Gray was thinking of the first Nemean
Ode of Pindar, wherein the infant Hercules is described as strangling
the snakes sent to destroy him by Juno:</p>

<div class="poem">

             <p class="i5">"<span title="[Greek: ho d' orthon

</div>

<p>Let me give a portion of Cowley's translation:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">

  <p> "The big-limb'd babe in his huge cradle lay,</p>
    <p>  Too weighty to be rock'd by nurse's hands,</p>
         <p class="i3"> Wrapt in purple swaddling bands;</p>
      <p>When, lo! by jealous Juno's fierce commands,</p>
         <p class="i3"> Two dreadful serpents come.</p>

</div>

<div class="stanza">

     <p> "All naked from her bed the passionate mother lept</p>
           <p class="i3">To save, or perish with her child,</p>
     <p> She trembled, and she cry'd; the mighty infant smiled:</p>
        <p class="i3"> The mighty infant seem'd well pleased</p>
              <p class="i5">At his gay gilded foes,</p>
    <p>  And as their spotted necks up to the cradle rose,</p>
      <p><i>With his young warlike hands on both he seiz'd</i>."</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The stretching forth of the child's hands he found in Pindar and Cowley;
his "smiling" in Cowley alone, for there is no trace of it in the
original. While speaking of Gray, one scarcely likes alluding to that
great <i>whetstone</i>, Dr. Johnson; for certainly the darkest shade on his
well-merited literary reputation arises from his unjust, ill-natured,
and unscholarlike criticisms upon a poet whose sole transgression was to
have been his cotemporary. But Johnson eulogises Shakspeare, as did
Gray, and I cannot help thinking that he, as well as Gray, was indebted
to Cowley: <i>e.g.</i> Johnson writes:</p>

  <div class="poem">
<p> "When Learning's triumph o'er her barb'rous foes</p>
<p> First rear'd the stage, immortal Shakspeare rose;</p>
<p>      Each change of many-colour'd life he drew,</p>
<p>      Exhausted worlds, and then imagin'd new:</p>
     <p> Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign,</p>
<p>  <i>And panting Time toil'd after him in vain</i>."</p>

     <p class="author"> <i>Prologue spoken by Mr. Garrick at the opening of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, 1747.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "He did the utmost bounds of knowledge find;</p>
    <p>  He found them not so large as was his mind,</p>
     <p> But, like the large Pellaean youth, did mone</p>
     <p> Because that art had no more worlds than one.</p>
     <p> And when he saw that he through all had past,</p>
   <p>   He dy'd, lest he should idle grow at last."</p>

<p>And with Dr. Johnson's sixth line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

  <p> "Panting Time toil'd after him in vain,"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">we may, I think, compare Cowley's description of King David's earlier
years:</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>But to return to Gray, Ode VI. "The Bard:"</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "With haggard eyes the poet stood,</p>
      <p>Loose his beard, and hoary hair</p>
      <p><i>Stream'd, like a meteor, to the troubled air</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>Wakefield quotes <i>Paradise Lost</i>, lib. i. 535.:</p>

  <div class="poem">

 <p> "The imperial ensign, which full high advanc'd,</p>
     <p> Shone <i>like a meteor streaming to the wind</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>Campbell, in <i>The Pleasures of Hope</i>, Part I., <i>does</i> borrow from Milton
in the above passage:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Where Andes, giant of the western star,</p>
     <p> With <i>meteor standard to the winds unfurl'd</i>;"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">but Gray is alluding to <i>hair</i>, and not to a standard; to the original
derivation of the word <i>comet</i> (<span title="[Greek: komê]">&#954;&#8057;&#956;&#951;</span>), and possibly to a
different passage in Milton, viz. <i>Par. Lost</i>, ii. 706.:<a id="lost253"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[253]</span></p>

<div class="poem">
                           <p class="i9"> "on the other side,</p>
     <p> Incens'd with indignation, Satan stood</p>
     <p> Unterrified: and like a <i>comet</i> burned,</p>
     <p> That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge,</p>
     <p>In the arctic sky, and from his horrid <i>hair</i></p>
     <p> Shakes pestilence and war."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Or as Virgil before him, <i>Æneid</i>, lib. x. 270.:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>"<i>Ardet apex capiti, cristisque a vertici flamma</i></p>
<p>Funditur, et vastos umbo vomit aureus ignes:</p>
<p>Non secus, ac liquida si quando nocti <i>cometæ</i></p>

</div>

<p>One of the meanings of <span title="[Greek: komê]">&#954;&#8057;&#956;&#951;</span> is "the luminous tail of a comet;"
and Suidas mentions from the LXX, <span title="[Greek: kai hesperon ton astera epi =komês= autou axeis

Liddell's <i>Lexicon</i> at the words <span title="[Greek: Komê]">&#922;&#8057;&#956;&#951;</span>,
and <span title="[Greek: Pôgôn]">&#928;&#8061;&#947;&#969;&#957;</span> and
<span title="[Greek: Pôgônias]">&#928;&#969;&#947;&#969;&#957;&#8055;&#945;&#962;</span>, which latter words are used in reference to the <i>beard</i> of
a comet.</p>

<p>Gray must now speak for himself. He says in a note:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">   "The image was taken from a well-known picture of Raphael,
   representing the Supreme Being in the Vision of Ezekiel. There
   are two of these paintings, both believed originals, one at
   Florence, the other at Paris."</p>

<p class="noindent">And Mr. Mason adds, in a note to his edition of Gray, vol. i. p. 75.
Lond. 1807:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "Moses breaking the Tables of the Law, by Parmegiano, was a
   figure which Mr. Gray used to say came still nearer to his
   meaning than the picture of Raphael."</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that Cowley too was not forgotten. Speaking of
the angel Gabriel, he says:</p>
<div class="poem">

     <p> "An harmless flaming <i>meteor</i> shone for <i>haire</i>,</p>
    <p>  And fell adown his shoulders with loose care."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Indeed, I must give the entire passage, however fantastic or unconnected
with my purpose; for the last four lines, which describe the angel's
<i>wings</i>, appear beyond measure dreamy and beautiful:</p>

<div class="poem">

   <p>   "When Gabriel (no blest spirit more kind or fair)</p>
  <p>    Bodies and cloathes himself with thicken'd air,</p>
    <p>  All like a comely youth in life's fresh bloom;</p>
    <p>  Rare workmanship, and wrought by heavenly loom!</p>
    <p>  He took for skin a cloud most soft and bright,</p>
     <p> That ere the mid day sun pierc'd through with light:</p>
    <p>  Upon his cheeks a lively blush he spread,</p>
    <p>  Wash't from the morning's beauties deepest red.</p>
    <p>  An harmless flaming meteor shone for haire</p>
     <p> And fell adown his shoulders with loose care.</p>
     <p> He cuts out a silk mantle from the skies,</p>
     <p> Where the most sprightly azure pleas'd the eyes.</p>
     <p> This he with starry vapours spangles all,</p>
     <p> Took in their prime ere they grow ripe and fall.</p>
    <p>  Of a new rainbow ere it fret or fade,</p>
     <p> The choicest piece took out, a scarf is made.</p>
      <p><i>Small streaming clouds he does for wings display</i>,</p>
     <p> <i>Not virtuous lovers' sighs more soft than they</i>.</p>
      <p><i>These he gilds o'er with the sun's richest rays</i>,</p>
      <p><i>Caught gliding o'er pure streams on which he plays.</i>"</p>

 <p class="author"> <i>Davideis</i>, lib. ii. ad finem.</p>

</div>

<p>Again, in a verse which was inserted in the <i>Elegy</i> as it originally
stood (and the subsequent rejection of which we must ever grieve over,
as it almost surpasses any verse of the entire poem; and besides would
have saved it from the imputation of having been written as a heathen
poet would have written it), the words "sacred calm" occur, which are
not unfrequent in Cowley:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Hark how the <i>sacred calm</i> that breathes around</p>
     <p> Bids every fierce tumultuous passion cease;</p>
     <p> In still small accents whispering from the ground,</p>
      <p>A grateful earnest of eternal peace."&mdash;</p>

<p>I have always believed that Gray was imitating Bishop Jeremy Taylor:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">   "Marriage is the mother of the world, and preserves kingdoms, and
   fills cities, and churches, and heaven itself. <i>Celibate, like
   the fly in the heart of an apple</i>, dwells in a perpetual
   sweetness, but sits alone, and is confined and dies in
   singularity."&mdash;Sermon XVII. <i>The Marriage Ring</i>, Part I.</p>

<p>If these random notes be interesting to any of your readers, they are
only a portion out of many I could send; and any one who doubts Gray's
partiality for Cowley may compare his second verse of the "Ode to

<p>To these lines on Crashaw Pope is indebted for a sentiment which in his
hands assumes a very infidel form:</p>


  <div class="poem">

  <p> "For modes of faith let senseless bigots fight;</p>
     <p> His can't be wrong whose life is in the right."</p>

</div>

<p>Crashaw had become a Roman Catholic, and was a canon of Loretto when he
died; but Cowley's Protestant feelings could not blind him to his worth,
and he says:</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "His <i>Faith</i> perhaps in some nice tenets might</p>
     <p> Be wrong; his <i>Life</i>, his soul were <i>in the Right</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>How much the two last-mentioned poems of Gray's owe to Milton's "Lines
to Mansus" and his "Epitaphium Damonis," any one acquainted with them
may remember. I have only been alluding to Gray's reproductions of
Cowley.</p>

<h4><span><i>Remains of Sir Hugh Montgomery</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 206.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Allusion has been
made to the following stanza from "Chevy Chase:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Against Sir Hugh Montgomery,</p>
       <p class="i3"> So right his shaft he set,</p>
     <p> The grey goose wing that was thereon</p>
        <p class="i3">In his heart's blood was wet."</p>

<p class="noindent">Having lately visited the sea-bathing town of Largs, my attention was
attracted to a building in the churchyard forming the present burying
ground. In this building, bearing date of erection 1636 by Sir Robert
Montgomery (ancestor of the present Earl of Eglinton), there is an
elaborately carved tomb of mason work, beneath which is a strongly
arched stone vault, where, besides the founder and others, tradition has
placed the remains of the brave Sir Hugh Montgomery. It is difficult to
reconcile this with the long prior date of the battle of Chevy Chase,
unless the vault, which has certainly a very ancient look, can be
substantiated to have existed before the above building. Taking matters
as they go, the remains of the warrior now appear in the most
humiliating condition&mdash;reduced to a hard, dry bony skeleton deprived of
legs and thighs, with the singular appearance of the skull having been
cloven (most likely) by a battle-axe, the skull being held together by
some plate or substance and rude stitching. The body is said to have
been originally embalmed, and enclosed in a lead coffin, which was
barbarously torn off some forty years ago, as sinks for fishing nets.
The building, tomb, and vault, taken altogether, present perhaps one of
the finest specimens of this species of architecture in Scotland, and
are additionally curious from the cone roof of the building being highly
ornamented with descriptive paintings in a tolerable state of
preservation. It is understood that some historical notices of the whole
have been privately printed by a Scotch antiquarian, of which some of
your learned readers may be aware, and may furnish more ample details
than the foregoing.</p>

<h4><span><i>Westminster Hall.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The following extract from the <i>Issue Roll of
Michaelmas Term</i>, 9 Hen. VII. 1493, may be interesting to some of your
readers, and will perhaps lead to a speculation on the nature of "the
disguisyings" alluded to:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">   "To Richard Daland, for providing certain spectacles, or
   theatres, commonly called scaffolds, in the great hall at
   Westminster, for performance of 'the disguisyings,' exhibited to
   the people on the night of the Epiphany, as appears by a book of
   particulars; paid to his own hands, £28, 3<i>s.</i>
   5-<span class="topnum">3</span>/<span class="botnum">4</span><i>d.</i>"&mdash;Devon's <i>Issue Roll</i>, 516.</p>

<p>Possibly the next entry, which is in Michaelmas in the following year,
of a payment of five marks yearly "to John Englissh, Edward Maye,
Richard Gibson, and John Hamond, 'lusoribus Regis' otherwise called in
English the players of the king's interludes, for their fees,"&mdash;has some
connexion with "the disguisyings."</p>

<h4><span><i>Meaning of "Log-ship."</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;If you have a spare corner, can you grant it
to me for the origin of a word which describes an article used in every
sailing and steam vessel in the world, and yet perhaps not one sailor in
a thousand knows whence it is derived. I allude to the word "log-ship,"
the name of the little wooden float (quadrant-shaped) by which, with a
line attached, the vessel's speed is ascertained. Before the invention
of the line with "knots" on it, a "chip," or floating-scrap,<a id="scrap255"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[255]</span> was
thrown overboard forward, and the "master," or whoever it might be,
walked aft at the rate which the vessel passed the "chip," judging of
his pace from experience. Hence the term "log-ship," or "chip," which is
its true name.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Locusts of the New Testament.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;While in Greece last year, I was
talking one day with a highly intelligent person on the English
translation of the New Testament. In the course of our conversation he
said, that in the third chapter of St. Matthew's Gospel we had got an
entirely wrong meaning for the verse in which we are told the food of
St. John the Baptist, viz. "locusts and wild honey." I have not at this
moment a Testament in ancient Greek by me but in the Romaic the
paragraph alluded to runs thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">

<p>Verse 4. ... "<span title="[Greek: Kai hê trophê tou êton akrides, kai
 meli agrion.]">&#922;&#945;&#8054; &#7969; &#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#8052; &#964;&#959;&#965; &#7974;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#956;&#8051;&#955;&#953; &#7940;&#947;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;.</span>"</p>

</div>

<p>He said that the word <span title="[Greek: akrides]">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span>, which we have translated
"locusts," means rather the "young and tender parts of plants." Since
that time I have looked into various Lexicons and Dictionaries both of
the ancient and modern Greek, but have been unable to find anything to
assist me in fixing this meaning. In that of Hedericus, it is thus
given: "<span title="[Greek: Akris, idos, hê]">&#7944;&#954;&#961;&#8054;&#962;, &#8055;&#948;&#959;&#962;, &#7969;</span>, Locusta." There is also, however,
"<span title="[Greek: Akris, ios, hê]">&#7948;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#962;, &#953;&#959;&#962;, &#7969;</span>,
Summitas, cacumen montis. Ab <span title="[Greek: akros]">&#7940;&#954;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>,
summus." Whether there may be any confusion between these two words I
know not; and here, possibly, I may be assisted by some obliging reader.
I have consulted, along with a clergyman who is well skilled in Greek
literature, and who is perfectly acquainted with Romaic, many
commentaries; but in every one we found this passage either entirely
passed over, or very unsatisfactorily noticed.</p>

<h3><span>COINAGE OF VABALATHUS, PRINCE OF PALMYRA.</span></h3>

<p>A great boon would be conferred on numismatists if some of your
correspondents would endeavour to elucidate the puzzling legend
sometimes found on coins of this prince.</p>

<p>Vabalathus, or Vhabalathus, Athenodorus (which Mionnet and Akerman make
to be the Greek translation of Vabalathus), was the son of the
celebrated Zenobia, by an Arab prince, and was raised to the imperial
dignity by his mother. His sway extended over some parts of Syria and
Egypt, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 266-273.</p>

<p>Aurelian gave to Vabalathus a petty province of Armenia, of which he
made him king, though perhaps this arose from the mistake of Occo and
Salmasius (<i>in Vopisc.</i> p. 380.) in
reading <span title="[Greek: ARMENIAS]">&#913;&#929;&#924;&#917;&#925;&#921;&#913;&#1017;</span>
for <span title="[Greek: AUG . HERMIAS]">&#913;&#933;&#915; . &#917;&#929;&#924;&#921;&#913;&#1017;</span>  on
his Egyptian coins (Vide infra).</p>

<p>His portrait appears on the reverse of coins of Aurelian, with the
legend VABALATHVS . VCRIMDR. Frölich and Corsini have unsuccessfully
attempted the interpretation of this word. Père Hardouin, considering,
VCRIMOR as the correct reading, divides it V. C. R. IM. OR., i.e. <i>Vice
Cæsaris Rector Imperii Orientis</i>; but, as Banduri rightly observes, the
existence of this legend is extremely doubtful, VCRIMDR being the
authorised one, and is undoubtedly so in a specimen in my cabinet; and
though the worthy Jesuit remarks, "Barbaram vocem aliquam arbitrari sub
hisce Notis Latinis latere, frigidum genus exceptionis est, ac
desperantium," I am inclined to think that the true interpretation is to
be sought in the Syriac, or some of the Oriental languages.</p>

<p>I have two others in my collection, of the rude third brass of the
Egyptian mint: Obv. AURELIAN, &amp;c.</p>

<h4><span>196. <i>The Island of Ægina.</i></span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Having occasion to make some inquiry about
the island of Ægina, in Greece, I have been sadly perplexed by the
discrepancies of the modern authorities I have had an opportunity of
consulting. The principal of these relates to the site of the temple of
Jupiter, or Zeus Panhellenios, which Dr. Smith's <i>Classical Dictionary</i>,
and M'Culloch's and Fullerton's <i>Gazetteers</i>, place in the N.E. part of
the island; Fullerton, however, saying also that Mount St. Elias lies in
<i>the south part</i>, though he does not say that the temple is built on
that mount. But Blaikie's <i>Gazetteer</i> says that the temple stands on
<i>Mount St. Elias</i>, which, according to Fullerton, is in the <i>south</i>.
With this agrees the map in the <i>Topographisch-historisch Atlas von
Hellas</i>, &amp;c. von H. Kiepert, Berlin, 1846, which distinctly places the
"Tempel von Zeus Panhellenios" in the <i>south</i> part of the island while
the temple in the <i>north-east</i> is called "Tempel von Athena." The
Atlas<a id="Atlas256"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[256]</span> to Anacharsis' <i>Travels</i> places it also in the <i>south</i>.
Which of these authorities is right? or, can any of your readers tell
me, from personal knowledge, in what part of the island the said Temple
of Zeus Panhellenios really stands?</p>

<p>&mdash;There is a series of ancient
tapestries in Bamburgh Castle, Northumberland, representing certain
events in the life of the emperor Justinian. One of these exhibits him
in the act of making his celebrated Digest of Law, surrounded by his
lawyers; in a second, he is manumitting slaves before the temple of
Janus, at the time, I presume, when he proclaimed the <i>eternal peace</i>,
which lasted two years; in a third, he appears crowned, on his knees,
swearing, it should seem, to observe the <i>Lex Romana</i>, which is held up
to him in an open book by two lictors; in the fourth, he is seen in a
wild country, with a hunting spear in his hand, coming, as it were by
surprise, and in great alarm, upon two hounds in the agonies of death. A
dish, from which they may have taken poison, lies on the foreground; and
a stream, which may possibly have been poisoned, gushes from a
neighbouring rock. Figures in the background seem to be slinking away
from the scene here represented.</p>

can you or any of your correspondents tell me whether it is from the
midnight succeeding, or the midnight preceding our noon of the same
number? For instance, taking the longitude of Berlin to be
 0<span class="topnum">h</span> 53<span class="topnum">m</span>
35<span class="topnum">s</span> .5 East, would the
 present moment, which is September 17, 3<span class="topnum">h</span>

16<span class="topnum">h</span> 34<span class="topnum">m</span> 5<span class="topnum">s</span> .5? (I have reckoned to days by ordinals, as, 1st,
2nd, 3rd, &amp;c., without a 0-day, which, however, the foreigners generally
use, employing a cardinal number, the hours minutes, and seconds being

   substituted others in their room, among whom was <i>the celebrated
   Archbishop of Splalato, then Dean of Windsor</i>."</p>

<p>I wish to ask who this archbishop was? and should be glad to learn any
further particulars respecting him, especially as to whether he ever
acted as a bishop in England? <i>Splalato</i> is, I presume, an error of the
press for <i>Spalatro</i>.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  [Mark Antony de Dominis, born about 1561, was educated among the
   Jesuits, and was Bishop of Segni, and afterwards Archbishop of
   Spalatro. Bishop Bedell met with him at Venice, and corrected,
   previous to publication, his celebrated work <i>De Republica
   Ecclesiastica</i>. When Bedell returned to England, Dominis came
   over with him. Here he preached and wrote against the Romanists,
   and the king gave him the Deanery of Windsor, the Mastership of
   the Savoy, and the rich living of West Ildesley in Berkshire. De
   Dominis's wish seems to have been to re-unite the Romish and
   English churches. He returned to Rome in 1622, where he abjured
   his errors, but on the discovery of a correspondence which he
   held with some Protestants, he was thrown into prison, where he
   died in 1625. He was a man of great abilities and learning,
   although remarkable for a fickleness in religious matters. He was
   author of a work entitled <i>De Radiis Visus et Lucis in Vitris
   Perspectivis et Iride Tractatus</i>, and was the first person,
   according to Sir Isaac Newton, who had explained the phenomena of
   the colours of the rainbow. We are also indebted to him for
   Father Paul's <i>History of the Council of Trent</i>, the manuscript
   of which he procured for Archbishop Abbot.&mdash;See Chalmers's

been represented in the Cock Pit, in Drury Lane, at three in the
afternoon punctually, 1658? Thus it stands in Jacob, but is not
mentioned by Langbaine. The author of the <i>British Theatre</i>, however,
mentions a remarkable circumstance in regard to it, which is, that
Oliver Cromwell, who had prohibited all theatrical representations, not
only allowed this piece to be performed, but even himself actually read
and approved of it.</p>

relating to property in various parts of the Isle of Axholme, co.
Lincoln. The term is used in the description of property; for instance,
"All that <i>selion</i> piece or parcel of land situate, &amp;c." It does not
signify any particular quantity, for I have known it applied to fields
of all sizes, from five acres down to a quarter of an acre. Will some of
your numerous correspondents furnish an explanation of the word, and
from whence derived?</p>

   <i>seillon</i>, a ridge of land, or ground arising between two
   furrows, and contains no certain quantity, but sometimes more or
   less. Therefore Crompton says, that a selion of land cannot be in
   demand, because it is a thing uncertain.]</p>

<h3><span>PROPHECIES OF NOSTRADAMUS.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 86. 140.)</span></h3>

<p>Mr. H. C. D<span class="smcap lowercase">E</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">ROIX</span> may be assured that the first edition of the
Prophecies of Nostradamus is not only in the National Library, but in
several others, both in Paris and elsewhere. It is now, however, very
rare, though until lately little valued; for at the Duc de la Vallière's
sale, in 1783, it produced no more than seven livres ten sols,&mdash;not
quite seven shillings. De Bure makes no mention of it: nor was it in the
library of M. Gaignat, or various other collectors; so little sought for
was it then. Printed at Lyons "chès Macé Bonhomme, <span class="smcap lowercase">M:D:L:V.</span>," it thus
closes&mdash;"Achevé d'imprimer le iiii iour de Mai, <span class="smcap lowercase">M.D.L.V.</span>" It is a small
octavo of 46 leaves, as we learn from Brunet, and was republished the
following year at Avignon, still limited to four centuries; nor was a
complete edition, which extended to ten centuries, with two imperfect
ones, published till 1568, at Troyes (en Champagne), in 8vo. Numerous
editions succeeded, in which it is well known that every intervenient
occurrence of moment was sure to be introduced, always preceded by the
date of impression, so as to establish the claim of prophecy. I have
before me that of J. Janson, Amsterdam, 1668, 12mo., which is usually
associated with the Elzevir collection of works, though not proceeding
from the family's press either in Leyden or Amsterdam. Several attempts
at elucidating these pretended prophecies have been made, such as
<i>Commentaires sur les Centuries de Nostradamus</i>, par Charigny, 1596,
8vo.; <i>La Clef de Nostradamus</i>, 1710, 12mo.; and one so late as 1806, by
Théodore Bouys, 8vo. The distich "Nostra damus," &amp;c. was the playful
composition, according to La Monnoye, of the celebrated Genevan reformer
Théodore de Béze. By others it is attributed to the poet Jodelle: but
the author is still uncertain. Nostradamus, born in Provence, died in
July, 1566, aged sixty-eight. His second son published the Lives of the
Poets of his native province in 1575, 8vo.</p>

<p>Among those impositions on public credulity, one of the most famous is
that referred to by Bacon, in his twenty-fifth Essay, and which he, as
was then the prevalent belief, attributed to the astronomer John Müller,
usually known as Regiomontanus, of the fifteenth century, and so
denominated by Bacon. Its first application was to the irruption of the
French king, Charles VIII., into Naples, in 1488, when the impetuosity
of the invasion was characterised by the epithet, ever since so well
sustained, of "La Furia Francese." Again, in 1588 it was interpreted as
predictive of the Spanish attack on England by the misnomed "Invincible
Armada;" and the English Revolution of 1688 was similarly presumed to
have been foretold by it, which always referred to the special year
<i>eighty-eight</i> of each succeeding century; while the line expressive of
the century was correspondingly adjusted in the text. It was thus made
applicable to the great French Revolution, of which the unmistakeable
elements were laid in 1788, by the royal edict convoking the
States-General for the ensuing year, when it burst forth with dread
explosion. Its prediction, with the sole alteration of the century from
the original lines, was then thus expressed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

  <div class="stanza">

<p> "Post mille expletos a partu Virginis annos,</p>
      <p>Et septingentos rursus ab orbe datos</p>
 <p>     Octogessimus octavus mirabilis annus</p>
     <p> Ingruet: is secum tristia fata trahet.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Though long ascribed to Regiomontanus, whose death preceded its first
appearance, and therefore made its application to posterior events
appear prophetic, the real author, according to the astronomer Delambre,
was a German named Bruschius, of the sixteenth century, who pretended to
have discovered it on a tomb (we may suppose that of Regiomontanus) in
Bohemia, that learned man's country. Many other similar prophecies have
deluded the world, of which the most celebrated were those of the
Englishman Merlin. An early edition, printed in 1528, fetched sixteen
guineas in 1812 at the Roxburgh sale, though preceded by three or four.
It is in French, and at Gaignat's sale, in 1769, brought only thirty-one
livres. It was No. 2239. of the Catalogue.<a id="the259"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[259]</span></p>

   supposed to have arisen from the ancient system of <i>vassalage</i>,
   which gave the lord of the manor certain rights over his
   <i>vassal's bride</i>, and thus rendered the legitimacy of the eldest

<h3><span>PASSAGE IN VIRGIL.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 24. 88.)</span></h3>

<p>Permit me to make a few remarks on the passage of Virgil, "Viridesque
secant," &amp;c., and its attempted elucidation, Vol. iv., pp. 88, 89.</p>

<p>It is stated that the translation is not correct, and also that Servius
was a very illiterate, ignorant, and narrow-minded man, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the short notice of Servius and his works in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>,
we have a very different character of him. Which is to be believed, for
both cannot be right?</p>

<p>Harles, in his <i>Introd. in Notitiam Lit. Rom.</i>, speaks thus of the
<i>Commentaries of Servius</i>:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Quæ in libris Virgilii sub nomine Servii circumferuntur Scholia,
   eorum minima pars pertinet ad illum; sed farrago est ex
   antiquioribus commentariis Cornuti, Donati, &amp;c., et aliorum; immo
   vero ex recentioris ætatis interpretibus multa adjecta sunt et
   interpolata."</p>

<p>Thus condemning the interpolations, but leaving intact the matter really
belonging to Servius.</p>

<p>For a refutation of the impertinent comparison with a Yorkshire hedge
schoolmaster, and the erroneous appreciation of the <i>Commentaries</i>, I
must refer to the above-mentioned notice in the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>.</p>

<p>In the next place, with respect to the meaning of the passage:&mdash;the word
<i>seco</i>, when applied to the movements of ships, is usually rendered by
"sulco;" <i>e.g.</i>:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p> "Jamque fretum Minyæ Pegasæâ puppe secabant."</p>

<p class="author"> Ovid, <i>Met.</i> vii. 1.</p>
</div>

<p>See also lib. xi. 479. "Travel along" would be insufficient to express
the meaning in these instances; and <i>sulco</i> agrees with the modern
phrase, "ploughing the deep," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Moreover, I submit that the interpretation of <i>seco</i> is governed by the
context, inasmuch as its application to both land and water travelling
demands a different construction in the two cases. If this be allowed,
then comparison cannot be made between the line in question and "viam
secat ad naves;" for this refers to Æneas's leaving the infernals, after
his visit there; or "secuit sub nubibus arcum," which refers to cleaving
the air. Heyne's note is "secuit ... arcum; secando aerem fecit arcum;
incessit per arcum."</p>

<p>The clearness or muddiness of the river has no connexion with the
translation; for the words "placido æquore" clearly and definitely
express the state of the <i>surface</i> of the river, and it is such as is
required to favour the reflection of the trees, through whose images the
ships ploughed their way; and, to make the sense perfect, the words
"variis teguntur arboribus" are all that is required as showing the
position of the trees with respect to the river.</p>

<p class="blockquot">P.S. I have not alluded to the special meaning of active verbs with
accusative (Qy. objective) cases after them, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="right"> <span title="[Hebrew: A. T.]">&#1514;.&#1488;.</span></p>



<p>The Query of your correspondent E<span class="smcap lowercase">RYX</span> has elicited two conflicting
opinions as to the meaning of the words "Viridesque secant placido
æquore silvas." Perhaps the following suggestion may help to set the
matter at rest.</p>

<p>If by these words is meant the cleaving of the shadows on the water, how
could they, with any propriety, be applied to a voyage that was
prosecuted during the darkness of the night as well as by the light of
day?</p>

<h4><span><i>Ell-rake</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 192.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;V<span class="smcap lowercase">ASHTI</span> inquires the derivation of
<i>ell-rake</i> or <i>hell-rake</i>. In this district (the Cotswolds) we generally
suppose the derivation to be from the rake being an ell in width. In the
vale, however (<i>i.e.</i> about Tewkesbury), they are called <i>heel-rakes</i>,
from their being drawn at the heel of the person using them, instead of
being used in front, as rakes ordinarily are.</p>

<p><i>Heel-rake</i>, <i>Ell-rake</i>, or <i>Hell-rake</i>, is a large rake, which upon
being drawn along the ground the teeth run close to the heels of the
person drawing it. This has given it the name of <i>heel-rake</i>, its right
name. In Shropshire (and probably in other counties also) this has
become contracted into <i>ell-rake</i>.</p>

<h4><span><i>Freedom from Serpents</i></span> <span>(Vol. iii., p. 490.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Ireland is not the only
country supposed to be inimical to reptiles. I may perhaps be allowed to
add to the "Note" of your correspondent as to Ireland, that the Maltese
declare that St. Paul after his shipwreck cursed all the venomous
reptiles<a id="rep261"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[261]</span> of the island, and banished them for ever, just as St.
Patrick is said to have afterwards treated those of his favourite isle.
Whatever be the cause of it, the fact is alleged by travellers to be
certain, that there are <i>no venomous animals in Malta</i>. "They assured
us" (says Brydone in his <i>Tour through Sicily and Malta</i>, vol. ii. p.
35.) "that vipers have been brought from Sicily, and died almost
immediately on their arrival."</p>

<p>Although perhaps more strictly coming under the head of folk lore, I may
here advert to the traditions found in several parts of England, that
venomous reptiles were banished by saints who came to live there. I have
read that Keynsham&mdash;the hermitage of Keynes, a Cambrian lady, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
490&mdash;was infested with serpents, which were converted by her prayers
into the "Serpent-stones"&mdash;the <i>Cornua Ammonis</i>&mdash;that now cover the
land. A similar story is told at Whitby, where these fine fossils of the
Lias are called "St. Hilda's Serpent-stones;" and so, too, St. Godric,
the famous hermit of Finchale, near Durham, is said to have destroyed
the native race of serpents.</p>

<h4><span><i>Nao, for Naw, for Ship</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., pp. 28. 214.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I am obliged to
G<span class="smcap lowercase">OMER</span> for his reference to Davies. In the cited passages from Taliesin
and Meigant, <i>heb naw</i> means without being able to swim. The word <i>nawv</i>
drops its final letter in order to furnish the rhyme. That appears, not
only from the rejection of the word by all lexicographers, but from one
of the manuscripts of Meigant, which actually writes it <i>nawv</i>. I esteem
Davies's translation to be Daviesian.</p>

<p>By way of a gentle pull at the torques, I will observe, that I am not in
the habit of proving that people "did <i>not</i> possess" a thing, but of
inquiring for the evidence that they did. And when I find that tattooed
and nearly naked people used coracles, and do not find that they used
anything grander, I am led to suspect they did not.</p>

<p>My answer to the Query, whether it be probable that British warriors
went over to Gaul in coracles is, "Yes, highly so." Rude canoes of
various sorts convey the expeditions of savage islanders in all seas.
And the coracle rendered the Scots of Erin formidable to the Roman
shores of Gaul and Britain. I do not see that the Dorsetshire folk being
"water-dwellers" (if so be they were such) proved them to have used
proper ships, any more than their being "water-drinkers" would prove
them to have used glasses or silver tankards.</p>

<p>No doubt the name <span title="[Greek: naus]">&#957;&#945;&#8166;&#962;</span> is of the remotest heroic antiquity, and
the first osier bark covered with hides, or even the first excavated
alder trunk, may have been so termed; in connexion with the verbal form
<i>nao</i>, contract. <i>no</i>, <i>nas</i>, pret. <i>navi</i>, to float or swim. But to
"advance that opinion" as to Britain, because two revolted Roman
subjects in this province used the word in the sixth and seventh
centuries after Christ, would be late and tardy proof of the fact; even
supposing that the two bards in question had made use of such a noun,
which I dispute.</p>

<h4><span><i>De Grammont</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 233.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;On the united authority of messieurs
Auger and Renouard, editors of the works of le comte Antoine Hamilton,
it may be affirmed that there is no edition of the <i>Mémoires du comte de
Grammont</i> anterior to that of 1713. M. Renouard thus expresses himself:
"En 1713 parurent les <i>Mémoires</i>, sans nom d'auteur, en un vol. in-12,
imprimé en Hollande sous la date de Cologne."</p>

<p>&mdash;The termination "-ship"
is the Anglo-Saxon <i>scipe</i>, <i>scype</i>, from verb <i>scipan</i>, to create,
form; and hence as a termination of nouns denotes <i>form</i>, <i>condition</i>,
<i>office</i>, <i>dignity</i>.</p>

<h4><span><i>The Five Fingers</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., pp. 150. 193.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;With something like
compunction for lavishing on Macrobius and his prosy compeers so many
precious hours of a life that is waning fast, permit me to refer you to
his <i>Saturnalia</i>, vii. 13., ed. Gryph. 1560, p. 722., for the nursery
names of the five fingers. They nearly coincide with those still
denoting those useful implements in one of the Low-Norman isles, to wit,
<i>Gros det</i>, <i>ari det (hari det?)</i>, <i>longuedon</i> or <i>mousqueton</i>, <i>Jean
des sceas</i>, <i>courtelas</i>. The said <i>Jean des sceas</i> is, of course, "John
of the Seals," the "annularis" or ring-finger of Macrobius and the
Anglican Office-Book. Among the Hebrews
<span title="[Hebrew: etsba elohim]">&#1488;&#1510;&#1489;&#1506; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;</span>, "the finger of God,"
denoted His power; and it was the forefinger, among the gods of Greece
and Italy, which wore the ring, the emblem of divine supremacy.</p>

<h4><span><i>Marriages within ruined Churches</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 231.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;The beautiful
old church of St. John in the Wilderness, near Exmouth, is in ruins.
Having in 1850 asked the old man who points out its battered beauties,
why there were still books in the reading desks, he informed me that
marriages and funeral services were still performed there. This,
however, is my only authority on the subject.</p>

<h4><span><i>Death of Cervantes</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 116.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;No doubt now exists that the
death of Cervantes occurred on the 23rd of April, 1616, and not the 20th
of that month, which Smollett represents as the received date. In the
Spanish Academy's edition, the magnificent one of 1780, as well as in
that of 1797, it is so affirmed. In the former we read that on the 18th
he received the sacrament of extreme unction with great calmness of
spirit. It then adds:<a id="adds262"></a>  <span  class="pagenum">[262]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Igual serenidad mantuvo haste el último punto de la vida. Otorgó
   testamento dexando por albaceas á su muger Doña Catalina de
   Salazar, y al Licenciado Francisco Nuñez, que vivia en la misma
   casa: mandó que le sepultasen en las Monjas Trinitarias; y murió
   á 23 del expresado mes de Abril, de edad de 68 años, 6 meses, y
   14 dias."</p>

<p>The coincidence, however, of the renowned Spaniard's death with that of
our Shakspeare, who certainly died apparently on the same day, the 23rd
of April, 1616, on which, at a singularity, Mr. Frere, with others,
dwells, wholly fails; for, in fact, that day in Spain corresponded not
with the 23rd, but the 13th, in England. It is forgotten that the
Gregorian or Reformed Calendar was then adopted in Spain, and that
between it and the unreformed style of England a difference in that
century existed of ten days:&mdash;thus, the execution of Charles I., in our
writers, and in the Book of Common Prayer, is always dated on the 30th
of January, while on the continent it is represented as on the 9th of
February. The Reformed Calendar was adopted and promulgated by Pope
Gregory XIII. in 1582, while rejected by England, though acknowledged to
be correct, until 1751, because coming from Rome. This disgraceful
submission to prejudice in repudiation of a demonstrated scientific
truth, practically sanctioned by a Napier, a Newton, a Halley, &amp;c., is
still pursued in the Greek church and Russian empire, where the present
day, the 17th of September, is the 5th.</p>

<h4><span><i>Story referred to by Jeremy Taylor</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 208.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;Although
unable to point out the source whence Jeremy Taylor derived the story to
which A. T<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. alludes, I may be excused for referring your correspondent
to <i>Don Quixote</i>, Part II. book <span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span> chap. xiii., where the story,
somewhat amplified, is given; but with this difference, that the staff
is not broken by the injured person, but by Signor Don Sancho Panza,
Governor of Barataria, before whom the case is brought for adjudication.
That the story was founded on an older one may be well inferred, from
its being stated that "Sancho had heard such a story told by the curate
of his village; and his memory was so tenacious, in retaining everything
he wanted to remember, that there was not such another in the whole
island."</p>

<h4><span><i>Gray's Obligations to Jeremy Taylor</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 204.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;I perfectly
agree with R<span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>. in his admiration for Gray; but, to my shame be it
spoken, am not very well read in Jeremy Taylor. R<span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>. would oblige me, as
well as other admirers of "the sweet Lyrist of Peter-house," by
furnishing an example or two of the latter's obligations to the bishop.</p>

<p>R<span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>. will excuse me if I fail to perceive any great degree of similarity
between his two last quoted passages from Gray and those from Cowley,
which he adduces as parallel. This refers especially to the last
instance, in which I trace scarcely any similarity beyond that of a
place of education and a river being commemorated in each. Would R<span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>.
supply us with a few more examples of borrowing from Cowley?</p>

<p>With R<span class="smcap lowercase">T</span>.'s wish for a new edition of Gray, "with the parallel passages
annexed," I cordially coincide. However, failing this new edition, he
will allow me to recommend to his notice (if indeed he has not seen it)
the Eton edition of the poet, with introductory stanzas of great
elegance and beauty, by another of Eton's bards, the Rev. J. Moultrie,
author of that most pathetic little poem "My Brother's Grave."</p>

<h4><span><i>Blessing by the Hand</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 74.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;An impression of the stamp
on the bread used in the Eucharist in Greece (mentioned in the above
Note) may be seen in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. It was cut off a loaf
in the remarkable monastery of Megaspelion in the Morea, by</p>

<h4><span><i>Sacre Cheveux</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 208.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;This is a literal translation into
heraldic language of the name of the family which uses it for a motto:
<i>Halifax</i> = <i>holy-hair</i>, from the Anglo Saxon <i>hali</i>, or <i>halig</i>, and
<i>fax</i> or <i>feax</i>. Tradition connects the origin of the Yorkshire town of
that name with a head of singular length and beauty of hair, found at or
near the place where the Halifax gibbet used to stand.</p>

<h4><span><i>Pope and Flatman</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 210.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;E. V. has entirely overlooked
the very material circumstance that Flatman's poem was cited in your
periodical (Vol. iv., p. 132.) from a book published in 1688,
twenty-four years before the date he assigns to the composition of
Pope's ode. Flatman died 8th December, 1688, and Pope was born 22d May,
1688; so that he was little more than six months old at the time of
Flatman's death. I have now before me the 4th edition of Flatman's
<i>Poems and Songs</i>, London, 8vo., 1686; "A Thought of Death" occurs at p.
55.</p>

<h4><span><i>Linteamina and Surplices</i></span> <span>(Vol. iv., p. 192.).</span></h4>

<p>&mdash;In Goar's <i>Rituale
Græcorum</i>, the most complete account is given of the ancient vestments
of the priesthood, from which, or rather from the same source, those of
the Romish and English churches have been derived. The names of these
vestments are <span title="[Greek: stoicharion]">&#963;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#967;&#8049;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>,
<span title="[Greek: hôrarion]">&#8033;&#961;&#945;&#961;&#8055;&#959;&#957;</span>,
<span title="[Greek: epimanikia]">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#957;&#8055;&#954;&#953;&#945;</span>,
<span title="[Greek: epitrachêlion]">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#967;&#8053;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>,
<span title="[Greek: zônê]">&#950;&#8061;&#957;&#951;</span>,
<span title="[Greek: hypogonation]">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#8049;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>,
<span title="[Greek: phelônion]">&#966;&#949;&#955;&#8061;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>,
and <span title="[Greek: epigonation]">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#8049;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>.</p>

<p>These were put on and taken off in the presence of the congregation, and
a form of prayer appropriate to each vestment was repeated
 (<span title="[Greek: mystikôs]">&#956;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;</span>) by<a id="by263"></a> <span  class="pagenum">[263]</span> the priest and deacon. In the notes of Goar and the
accompanying plates, ample information is afforded of the symbolic
meaning of these garments, both in respect of form and colour.</p>

<p>This meaning, lost to considerable extent by the Romish church, is
recoverable by reference to the Greek rituals, which have retained,
probably with little alteration, the ancient services of the early
Christians. An explanation will therein be found of other matters
besides linteamina and surplices by those who are curious in rituology,
as of the <span title="[Greek: diskon sphragidos, lonchê, astêriskon, kalymma,

<h3><span>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</span></h3>


<p>By all who are interested in the study of early German Poetry and
Literature, the name of Von der Hagen must be gratefully remembered for
the many curious and valuable works which he has published, sometimes
under his sole editorship, at others, in conjunction with Busching,
Primisser, &amp;c. But far exceeding in interest any which he has before
given to the press, especially to English readers, is one which we
received some time since from Messrs. Williams and Norgate, but have
only recently had an opportunity of examining. It is in three thick and
closely printed octavos, and is entitled <i>Gesammtabentheuer: Hundert
altdeutsche Erzählungen, Ritter-und Pfaffen-Mären, Stadt-und
Dorfgeschichten, Schwänke, Wundersagen und Legenden, meist zum erstenmal
gedruckt</i>, &amp;c. This collection embraces, as the title accurately enough
describes, a hundred early German Stories of every possible kind,
Stories of Knights and Friars, of Cities and Villages, Merry Jests,
Tales of Wonder, and Legends; and resembles in many respects the popular
collections of French Fabliaux edited by Barbazan, Le Grand d'Aussy, &amp;c.
These are for the most part now printed for the first time; and besides
the illustrations they afford of that love of humour, a characteristic
of the German mind the existence of which it has been too much the
fashion to deny, and to which we owe <i>Owlglas</i> and the <i>Schildburger</i>,
these "hundred merry Tales" are of no small importance for the light
they throw upon the history of Fiction&mdash;a subject which, in spite of the
labour bestowed upon it by Dunlop, Walter Scott, Palgrave, and
Keightley, is yet very far from being fully developed.</p>

<p>The new part of <i>The Traveller's Library</i> contains Mr. Macaulay's
brilliant essays on Ranke's <i>History of the Popes</i>, and Gladstone <i>On
Church and State</i>.</p>

<p>Messrs. Longman having become the sole proprietors of that valuable
series of works <i>The Cabinet Cyclopædia</i>, have announced a re-issue of
them at the reduced price of three shillings and sixpence per volume,
instead of six shillings, at which they were originally published.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
